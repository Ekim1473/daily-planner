Daily Planner

This project is designed using HTML, JavaScript, jQuery and CSS. It is our week 5 assignment for Bootcamp.

You will find hours listed in blocks on the site that are assigned a time between the hours of 0700 and 1700. The current time will be visible with a red background, the past hours will have a grey background and the future hours will be in green. You can add your schedule and save. Upon save the text will be stored in the local storage and will remain on the page even after a refresh.

We were given some starter code and the HTML structure a the start of the assignment.
